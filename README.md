# cyber security mooc project

Course page: https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/module-3.1

This is a course project to demostrate different software security flaws and how to fix them.

I am using an old course project as a template. This app is for creating an overnight oats recipe bank. User can create and account, add a new recipe, comment a recipe, add it to favorites and search recipes. Especially the adding recipe function is quite rigid and not really usefull, but as the original course was about creating a webapp with database to it filled its purpose.
